# Plan-time tests for the homelab example using mocked providers.
#
# Exercises the example end-to-end with the in-cluster backing services
# selected: postgres_backend = "cnpg" + redis_backend = "valkey".
#
# The mocked-provider limitations documented in AGENTS.md apply here too:
# helm_release.values (and the k8s helm_release block itself) resolves to
# (known after apply) through the mocked kubernetes_namespace attribute chain,
# so asserts on the planned helm_release.n8n attributes (name, chart,
# namespace) are not possible under mocks. What IS assertable is that the
# module-level backing_services output resolves through local.k8s_pg_host /
# local.k8s_redis_host, which the CNPG + Valkey wiring both feed. Those
# assertions cover the "planned on the right backend" contract without
# reaching into resources whose attributes the mock provider defers.
#
# Run: terraform test
#   (from examples/homelab/, mocks require terraform >= 1.11)
